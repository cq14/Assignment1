5b. How many commits have been done to the repository so far? What 
	command have you used?
	
	10 commits
	$git log
	
5c. When was the file .gitignore modified last? What command was used?

	September 27 2017 - 16:31:42
	$ git log .gitignore
	
5d. Please list the IDs of the commits used to merge the changes from
	the branch "development" to the branch "master"
	
	commit 36a8e55e4bbdd171ab57d979e1a802d740f2db9b
	commit cb30d72a3d94c108f393c163a35c1cc9bf18ffca
	git log --merges
	
5e. Mention two reasons for branches

	- So developers could make sure their code changes are verified
	before delivering to other developers. Essentially to allow people
	to work in parallel
	- So developers could isolate their changes among the team. So for 
	example, there could be a branch for new features, and a separate branch 
	for bug fixes.
	
5f. Difference between git log and git status

	git log focus/displays commit history, while git status inspects the 
	working directory/staging area.
	
5g. What command would you use to see the commits where Weapon.h was one of
	the committed files.
	
	git log --follow Weapon.h

5h. What command would you use to see the commites whose commit message
	contains the word file

	git log --all --grep="file"

5i. In the context of Object Oriented programming
	What is inheritance?
		Ability for classes to receive the properties and functions of 
		already existing class. A child class would receive certain
		attributes from its parent class which it is derived from. 
		In OO Programming, there is a different access control within
		the class declaration file called "protected", which allows child 
		classes to access the certain property.
	
	What is plymorphism?
		the ability for a programming language to process objects differently
		based on their data type or class. Polymorphism gives the ability to
		redefine methods for classes.
		
	What is encapsulation?
		Encapsulation is the restriction of direct access to an object's
		member functions and member variables. Key words in a class declaration
		defines the exclusiveness of an objects properties: Public, private,
		protected, and these properties help prevent UNWANTED parties to have
		access to the class properties.
